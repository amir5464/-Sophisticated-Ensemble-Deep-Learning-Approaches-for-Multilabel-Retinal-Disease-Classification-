{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Data Loading and Image Path Addition\n","\n","In this code  data loading and image path addition are performed on three CSV files containing labels and metadata about retinal images. The goal is to load the data, add an 'IMG_DIR' column that specifies the image paths, and consolidate the data into a single DataFrame.\n","\n","#### Data Loading\n","\n","- Three CSV files containing labels and metadata are loaded into DataFrames using the `pd.read_csv` function. The files are:\n","  - `TRAIN_CSV_DIR`: Training labels.\n","  - `VAL_CSV_DIR`: Validation labels.\n","  - `TEST_CSV_DIR`: Testing labels.\n","\n","#### Adding Image Path Column\n","\n","- A custom function `add_image_path_column` is defined to add an 'IMG_DIR' column to a given DataFrame. This column is generated by applying a lambda function that constructs the image path based on the 'ID' column and the specified image directory.\n","\n","- A dictionary `directories` maps dataset names to their respective image directories.\n","\n","- A loop iterates over each dataset name and directory in the `directories` dictionary. For each dataset, the 'IMG_DIR' column is added to the corresponding DataFrame.\n","\n","#### Data Concatenation\n","\n","- The code concatenates the three DataFrames (`train_labels`, `val_labels`, and `test_labels`) into a single DataFrame `rfmid` using `pd.concat`. The resulting DataFrame `rfmid` contains all the labels and metadata from the three datasets.\n","\n","- The `df` variable is assigned the `rfmid` DataFrame, which can be used for further data processing and analysis.\n","\n","This code is useful for loading and preparing data for retinal image analysis, making it accessible for further analysis or model training.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-24T08:47:33.844147Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-24T08:47:33.843109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-24T08:47:34.426119Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-24T08:47:34.424758Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-24T08:47:33.844100Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

It uses the Albumentations library to perform cropping based on specified conditions. The conditions are determined by the input image's shape, and the corresponding cropper is applied.\n","\n","- Several cropping options are defined based on different image shapes, such as (1424, 2144, 3), (1536, 2048, 3), and more.\n","\n","- The `transform` method of the `Retinal_Crop` class selects the appropriate cropper based on the input image's shape and applies it.\n","\n","#### Data Processing\n","\n","- A CSV file specified by `csv_file` is read using pandas. This CSV file likely contains information about the images and their paths.\n","\n","- A `cropper` object is instantiated, which is an instance of the `Retinal_Crop` class.\n","\n","- An output directory named `output_image_folder` is created to store the cropped images.\n","\n","- The code uses a progress bar (`tqdm`) to track the processing of images. It iterates through each row in the DataFrame (loaded from the CSV file), opens the image, applies the appropriate cropping, and saves the cropped image to the output directory. The image path in the DataFrame is updated to point to the cropped image.\n","\n","- The code generates a new DataFrame with the updated image paths and saves it to a new CSV file specified by `new_csv_file`.\n","\n","This code is valuable for pre-processing retinal images, cropping them according to their shapes, and updating the DataFrame with the new image paths. It's an essential step when dealing with medical image data or other applications requiring precise image processing.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-24T08:50:40.478791Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-24T08:50:40.478371Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-24T10:36:37.128184Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-24T10:36:37.124392Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-24T08:50:40.478759Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Processing Images: 100%|██████████| 3200/3200 [1:45:53<00:00,  1.99s/image]  \n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","from PIL import Image\n","import numpy as np\n","from albumentations import Compose, CenterCrop, Crop\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","class Retinal_Crop:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.cropper_alpha = Compose([CenterCrop(width=1424,\n","                                                 height=1424,\n","                                                 p=1.0, always_apply=True)])\n","        self.cropper_beta = Compose([CenterCrop(width=1536,\n","                                                height=1536,\n","                                                p=1.0, always_apply=True)])\n","        self.cropper_gamma = Compose([Crop(x_min=100, x_max=4200,\n","                                           y_min=0, y_max=2848,\n","                                           p=1.0, always_apply=True)])\n","        self.cropper_a = Compose([Crop(x_min=0, x_max=2848,\n","                                           y_min=100, y_max=4200,\n","                                           p=1.0, always_apply=True)])\n","    def transform(self, image):\n","        if image.shape == (1424, 2144, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_alpha(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        elif image.shape == (1536, 2048, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_beta(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        elif image.shape == (2848, 4288, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_gamma(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        elif image.shape == (4288, 2848, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_a(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        elif image.shape == (2048, 1536, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_beta(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        elif image.shape == (2144, 1424, 3):\n","            return self.cropper_alpha(image=image)[\"image\"]\n","        else:\n","            print(\"No matching condition, returning original image.\")\n","            return image\n","\n","\n","csv_file = '/kaggle/working/rfmid_28.csv'\n","data_df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\n","\n","cropper = Retinal_Crop()\n","\n","\n","output_image_folder = 'images_crop'\n","os.makedirs(output_image_folder, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","\n","tqdm_bar = tqdm(total=len(data_df), desc='Processing Images', unit='image')\n","\n","processed_data = []\n","\n","for index, row in data_df.iterrows():\n","    img_path = row['IMG_DIR']\n","    img = Image.open(img_path)\n","    img_array = np.array(img)\n","    cropped_img = cropper.transform(img_array)\n","    img_split = os.path.dirname(img_path).split('/')[-1]\n","    new_img_name = os.path.basename(img_path).replace('.png', f'.png')\n","    output_image_path = os.path.join(output_image_folder, new_img_name)\n","    Image.fromarray(cropped_img).save(output_image_path)\n","\n","    new_row = row.copy()\n","    new_row['IMG_DIR'] = output_image_path  \n","    processed_data.append(new_row)\n","\n","    tqdm_bar.update(1) \n","\n","tqdm_bar.close()  \n","\n","\n","processed_df = pd.DataFrame(processed_data)\n","\n","\n","new_csv_file = 'image_crop.csv'\n","processed_df.to_csv(new_csv_file, index=False)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Resizing and Padding of Retinal Images\n","\n","This code  demonstrates the resizing and padding of retinal images to ensure they have consistent dimensions and are ready for further processing or modeling.\n","\n","#### Image Preprocessing\n","\n","- The code defines a function `square_resize_and_pad` that takes an image file path and a target size as input.
